Thank you for applying to adopt an abandoned Backdrop project. 

Please note the procedure to add new maintainers:

1. If you haven't already, please join the Backdrop Contrib group by submitting an application.
2. File an issue in the current project's issue queue requesting to help maintain the project.
3. If written permission is granted by a current maintainer, create a PR that adds your name to the README.md file in the list of maintainers. Either you, or the current maintainer may merge the PR.
4. If the project does not have a listed maintainer, or if a current maintainer does not respond within 2 weeks, *this issue* will be used to take over the project. 


**Please include a link to the issue you filed for the abandoned project.**
<!-- example: https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/abandoned_project -->

<!-- After confirming the project has been abandoned, a Backdrop Contrib administrator will add your name to the list of maintainers in that project's README.md file (Ideally, by merging the PR you filed). Once your name is listed in the README.md, you may act as the current maintainer. -->
