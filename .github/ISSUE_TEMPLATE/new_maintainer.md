# Backdrop Contrib Maintaier Application Template

We are excited and thrilled that you have an interest in joining the Backdrop contrib group!

To join the group, you will need to:

- Agree to the Backdrop Contributed Project Agreement, listed at
  https://github.com/backdrop-ops/contrib/blob/master/README.md.
- Submit your first Backdrop project for a quick spot-check / review or submit links to PRs or 
  commits to existing Backdrop projects.
- Have at least one recommendation from a person who is already a member of the Backdrop contrib group,
  if you are not submitting code for review at the time of application (for the
  purposes of managing issues and documentation).
  
Here are sample application request templates you can fill out to make the process go as 
smoothly as possible for the contrib application maintainers. There are three types of maintainer applications you can file an issue for in order to join the group. Please use only one template for your application and delete all of the other ones.

**Coder:**
- New project or ported Drupal module
- Help maintain an existing project

**Non-coder:**
- Help maintain project issue queues and documentation

Once you have filed an issue using one of the templates below, a member of the Backdrop contrib group will review your application and provide further instructions. Once again, thanks for your interest in joining the Backdrop contrib group, and we look forward to seeing you in the issue queues and on Gitter!

## New Project Maintainer

Hello Backdrop Contrib maintainers, I would like to join your group in order to add [link to project/d.o. module](https://drupal.org/project/my_project) to the Backdrop contrib repository. I have read through the [contrib readme](https://github.com/backdrop-ops/contrib/blob/master/README.md.) and agree to the "Backdrop Contributed Project Agreement" listed there. 

I have also read through [porting a module from Drupal 7](https://api.backdropcms.org/converting-modules-from-drupal) (if porting a module) and have informed the maintainers of that project of my intentions.

Backdrop project link: ...
(If porting a module) Drupal "intent to port" issue link: ...
